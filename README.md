## Problems we have faced !!!

During connecting the html page and the login form we faced a lot of problems regarding firebase...

Also we were unable to merge the sign in button in both the pages.

During the first half of our project we had a bit problem in adjusting the navigation bar which was a bit difficult to do to make it transparent.
